# User Story Back
Technical Constraints

  - Doesn't necessarily need a flashy GUI (can be simple)                                
  - Libs / external modules should only be used for tests                                      
  - Using best in industry agile engineering practices  
  - You consider the extensibility of the code produced.  Well factored code should be relatively easily extended [Rock, paper, scissors, lizard and Spock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock) may be a natural extension
  - That's a Minimum Viable Product: elegant and simple wins over feature rich
